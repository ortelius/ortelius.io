Code-level vulnerabilities pose a significant risk in the intricate landscape of cloud-native environments. Ortelius provides end-to-end monitoring, reporting, and faster remediation of security issues throughout the software supply chain. With Ortelius, organizations can swiftly address vulnerabilities in open-source packages, reducing the risk of costly delays and potential security incidents.

Many IT teams struggle to respond to threats due to the fragmented nature of decoupled, cloud-native architecture. [Sonatype’s 2024 Report](https://www.sonatype.com/en/press-releases/sonatypes-10th-annual-state-of-the-software-supply-chain-report) shows a 156% increase in open-source package vulnerabilities, exceeding 512k, with 80% of them unaddressed for over a year. Ortelius streamlines the remediation process by showing where impacted open-sources packages are running across the infrastructure for continuous package remediation.

The Ortelius Community, managed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation), maintains the latest version, with corporate support from  [DeployHub](https://www.deployhub.com).

With Ortelius, you can easily answer the question, “where is Log4J running?”

## Abraham Ortelius

<div class="wrapdiv">
<img class="wrapdiv_image" src="images/abrahamortelius.jpg" alt="Abraham Ortelius" style="width:121px; height:170px" />
<p class="wrapdiv_text">Abraham Ortelius made his name by collecting data from scientists, geographers, and cartographers of his time and transforming it into what the world now knows as a world Atlas. His Atlas, titled Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World), was published on May 20, 1570. His Atlas disrupted the way the world was seen, with the first concepts imagining continental drift. Also of interest are the sea monsters shown in the water – mythical creatures that were a subject of fascination in Ortelius’ generation.</p>

## A Thought Leader in Sharing
Ortelius also in some ways created on open source community of his day. To accomplish his goal, he was the first cartographers to give credit to his fellow scientists by adding their names to the Atlas. Ortelius was known to have corresponded with other professionals throughout Europe and pulled together their knowledge to create his publication and a truly global view of the world.

Thank you Abraham Ortelius for showing us the way.
