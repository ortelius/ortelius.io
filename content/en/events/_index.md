A panel discussion with [Erin Lovern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinlovern/) and [Buffi Gresh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buffig/)

This panel discussion brings together two experienced technical recruiters who will share insights into how they leverage LinkedIn to identify and connect with top talent. They will reveal the strategies they use to search for candidates, what makes a profile stand out, and the common red flags they encounter.

For job seekers, the panelists will provide practical tips on networking effectively, the importance of LinkedIn, and applying for jobs in a way that captures recruiters' attention. They will also discuss the do’s and don’ts of job applications, including how to navigate applicant tracking systems (ATS) and tailor applications for maximum visibility.

<h2 class="text-left">John Willis 
<br>AI-Powered Code Parsing and Semantic Analysis for DevOps Pipelines</h2>


As software development ecosystems grow increasingly complex, the need for intelligent DevOps automation in script analysis and dependency management becomes critical. Join Jon Willis as he explores cutting-edge tools and techniques that leverage AI-driven code parsing and semantic analysis to enhance DevOps workflows. He will discuss the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, CodeBERT, and OpenAI Codex in parsing infrastructure and automation scripts, including Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, Makefile, GitHub Actions, and Terraform. These models facilitate the identification of dependency installations (e.g., apt-get install, pip install, npm install) and pinpoint update points within scripts.
