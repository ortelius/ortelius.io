## 2026 BlogAThon

Join the Ortelius community for our 5th annual BlogAThon, a celebration of ideas, learning, and open source collaboration. Whether you’re just getting started with open source or you’re a seasoned practitioner, BlogAThon is your opportunity to share knowledge, tell your story, and help shape the future of post-deployment vulnerability management.

By participating, you’ll help advance the Ortelius mission to:

- Empower new contributors to become confident, productive members of the Ortelius open source community

- Accelerate adoption of the Ortelius platform by new users

- Educate the broader ecosystem on software supply chain, security, and DevOps topics—especially those focused on post-deployment vulnerability management

Our BlogAThon isn’t just about writing—it’s about becoming part of the Ortelius team and contributing to a growing community that values openness, collaboration, and impact. We can’t wait to welcome you.

## Rules of the BlogAThon

Everyone is invited to participate. Submit you blogs between April 1st and July 1st to receive an Ortelius "Ambassador" digital badge to get recognized for your efforts.
