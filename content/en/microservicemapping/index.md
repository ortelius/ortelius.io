## Control Open-Source Vulnerabilities

Take control of your open-source software security with the Ortelius vulnerability evidence store. Ortelius ensures you maintain a secure and up-to-date inventory of all the open-source components within your software supply chain. It empowers you to make fast, informed decisions about open-source usage across your entire infrastructure, from code to cloud.

Ortelius can quickly show you where an open-source package version is running across your infrastructure. A simple search on a package and version will provide you with a full inventory of where the package is running, and who is consuming it. This search provides teams a quick way to determine the impact of a CVE, and where it needs to be addressed.

## Evaluate OS Package OpenSSF Scorecard

OpenSSF Scorecard is a security tool developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) designed to automatically assess the security posture of open-source projects. By providing a set of automated checks to evaluate how well a project follows security best practices, it helps developers and organizations understand the security risks associated with the open-source software they rely on.

The Scorecard evaluates various aspects of a project, such as:

- Code review practices: Ensures changes are reviewed before being merged.
- Branch protection: Verifies that protected branches are used.
- Dependency management: Assesses how well the project manages and updates dependencies.
- Security policy: Checks whether the project has a defined security policy.
- Vulnerability reporting: Looks for processes in place for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
- Each project receives a score, allowing users to compare the security health of different open-source projects. This tool is especially useful for organizations looking to manage the risks associated with open-source software in their supply chains. 

Ortelius integrates with OpenSSF Scorecard giving you a centralized view of the results based on each individual component in your software supply chain.
