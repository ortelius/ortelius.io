## Control Threats Across Your Supply Chain



Ortelius delivers swift visibility on the deployment of open-source package versions across your infrastructure. A quick search on any package and version reveals a comprehensive inventory of its presence and usage. This capability provides your teams with the critical intel required to evaluate the operational impact of CVEs and swiftly deploy resources to neutralize vulnerabilities, pinpointing exactly where CVE patches are urgently needed.

## Evaluate OS Package OpenSSF Scorecard

Ortelius integrates seamlessly with OpenSSF Scorecard, providing a centralized command view of security assessments for every component within your software supply chain.

[OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev/), created by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://www.openssf.org) (OpenSSF), automatically assesses the security posture of open-source projects using checks for:

- **Code reviews**

- **Branch protection**

- **Dependency management**

- **Security policies**

- **Vulnerability reporting**

Each project receives a security score based on adherence to best practices.

Ortelius integrates with Scorecard by aggregating scores across hundreds of open-source packages, first at the component version level, then at the logical application version level. This gives you a complete, high-level view of your applicationâ€™s overall security posture without having to manually search for the score of each package.

## Centralized Application Security Posture Management

Ortelius operates in lockstep with leading security tools used in open-source projects, such as Sonatype and Veracode, centralizing results into a unified command dashboard. This integration delivers teams a clear, consolidated overview of the security status of components, reflecting the security posture across all relevant application versions within your operational domain.
