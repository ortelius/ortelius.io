### Track the Impact of Changes with Precision

Ortelius equips teams to monitor changes moving through the CI/CD pipeline in a decoupled architecture. It provides critical insight into why and by whom an artifact—such as a container, API, or microservice—was changed, and identifies which operational units are impacted.

By embedding DevSecOps data directly into the pipeline, Ortelius helps teams precisely assess the impact of changes. Each change can introduce new open-source packages—and with hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities discovered each year, it’s essential to identify and neutralize critical ones fast.

Ortelius generates comparative reports and calculates the “blast radius” of shared components, consolidating open-source package risk at both the component and logical application level. This strategic intelligence gives teams the visibility they need to stay mission-ready.

## Tracking Components Across All Attack Surfaces

Ortelius tracks component versions that form each application version. When a component is updated, it triggers a new logical version of all dependent applications, with refreshed SBOMs and CVE analyses tied directly to their deployment environments.

Because components include open-source packages identified in their SBOMs, Ortelius can pinpoint exactly where each package is running. This gives CISO teams actionable intelligence to rapidly assess risk and respond to supply chain threats with precision.
