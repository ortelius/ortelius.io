## Full-spectrum OS Package Visibility

The fragmented structure of cloud-native architectures creates operational blind spots, weakening teams' ability to respond quickly to threats. Unlike monolithic apps, cloud-native systems may generate hundreds of SBOMs scattered across repos, making threat detection and response difficult.

Ortelius acts as a force multiplier, aggregating SBOM data from decentralized environments to deliver full-spectrum visibility. In distributed systems, each component brings its own dependencies, vulnerabilities, and license issues. Ortelius consolidates this data into a unified operational view, helping teams detect risks early, neutralize threats, and meet mission-critical compliance requirements.

This centralized intelligence eliminates blind spots and keeps your software architecture secure, resilient, and mission-ready.

The Ortelius aggregated SBOM supports compliance with [Executive Order 14028 – Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028).

## Actionable SBOM Intelligence

Using stored SBOM data for every deployment, Ortelius conducts continuous surveillance for new vulnerabilities, even after artifacts are deployed. This is critical as open-source software vulnerabilities are announced daily, introducing new risks.

By persistently synching OSV.dev, Ortelius detects newly disclosed vulnerabilities the moment they're published. This enables rapid response, reduces attacker dwell time, and helps ensure compliance in a shifting threat environment.

Continuous scanning means your defenses stay current, your supply chain stays secure, and your operations remain resilient.
